Home Dotfiles
=============

The configuration files from my `$HOME` directory that I can’t live without.

These files are for a GNU toolchain,  rather than the default BSD binaries that
come with OS X (you can easily replace them with `brew`).

Don’t  forget  to **remove  any  personal  information** (eg  abbreviations  of
contact details  in `~/.vimrc`) before  making the contents of  this repository
public!
