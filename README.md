## Home Dotfiles
The configuration files from my `$HOME` dirercoty that I can't live without.

These files are for a GNU toolchain, rather than the default BSD binaries that come with OS X (you can easily replace them with `brew`.).

Don't forget to **remove any personal information** (e.g. abbreviations of contact details in `~/.vimrc`) before making the contents of this repository public!
