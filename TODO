* Replace:
  - neovim -> helix
  - ctags -> nothing?
  - bin/open -> some file browser?
  - (tree -> broot or something else??)

* Install some file browser; playerctl?; configure picom?

* Remove the _already unused_ Ligaturizer fork from my GitHub (from Fira days).

* Remove unused sourcing and aliases from bash config.

* Eliminate need for unstashed local changes!!

* Use 120 as line width, 4 as tabstop for everything by default.

* Maybe have another run-through to see if I can simplify remaining configs
  in general (and generally update to 120 chars etc?).

* Stop using `~/bin/` entirely?  (i.e. remove the code that adds it to PATH?)

* Remove bash completion for `k` kubectl alias; add completion for other
  aliases in `.bashrc_local` instead.
