* Replace:
  - i3 (i3lock, imagemagick, playerctl, scrot) -> xmonad? + picom
  - neovim -> helix
  - ctags -> nothing?
  - bin/open -> some file browser?
  - (tree -> broot or something else??)


* Remove the _already unused_ Ligaturizer fork from my GitHub (from Fira days).

* Update diff-highlight and git-prompt?

* Remove unused sourcing and aliases from bash config.

* Change default repo branch to `main` on GitHub.

* Eliminate need for unstashed local changes!!

* Use 120 as line width, 4 as tabstop for everything by default.

* Maybe have another run-through to see if I can simplify remaining configs
  in general (and generally update to 120 chars etc?).

* Stop using `~/bin/` entirely?  (i.e. remove the code that adds it to PATH?)
