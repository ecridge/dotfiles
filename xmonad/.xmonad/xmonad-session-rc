# On Ubuntu, the `/etc/X11/Xsession` script *sources* all the files under `/etc/X11/Xsession.d/` in lexical order.
# The final file there ultimately *execs* whatever command was specified under `Exec` in the desktop entry that
# was selected upon login.  For xmonad, the desktop entry is `/usr/share/xsessions/xmonad.desktop`, and the command
# ultimately runs `/usr/bin/xmonad-session`.  This is a script which execs xmonad itself, but before it does that,
# it sources this file -- if it exists.
